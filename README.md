# Anonimizer Web Service
This is a Java SOAP Web Service that will receive a text and will find
any english Name in it to then convert it to asterisk chars to make them
"anonymous", it will return the converted text.
e.g.

* **Text Received:** Hello Mary, how are the things there with Jonh
* **Text Returned after Conversion:** Hello \*\*\*\*, how are the things there with \*\*\*\*

## What I learned
* Create SOAP web service with Java and Glassfish server
* Deploy the SOAP web service to AWS (Elastic Beanstalk)
* Consume a SOAP web service (Swing Form)
* Test the web service
